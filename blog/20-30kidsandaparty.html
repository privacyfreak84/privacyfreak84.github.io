<h1>It was around 11 pm</h1>
<br>
<p>I was about to go to bed when something outside caught my attention. Noise.
I went to the balcony, and saw a small crowd gathered near the entrance to my apartment complex, and two police vehicles.
There seemed to be an incident of some sort.</p>
<br>
<p>For some time, I observed the situation. Slowly, even at this time, people came out of their houses to add to the crowd and voice their opinion, as if it was quite important. Their voices certainly got louder, their behavior more aggressive.</p>
<br>
<p>I checked my apartment complex's chat. There was a message from the president of the RWA, a video, actually. It explained much. In one of the towers, there was a party. Twenty to thirty kids, all aged fourteen to sixteen were, according to the suspect being interviewed in the video, <i>forcefully being made to consume alcohol.</i> Very believable indeed.</p>
<br>
<p>Back outside, another police vehicle arrived. A seemingly innocent car had come some time ago to cross the road, but the large barrier of people didn't allow it to. They started arguing. The entire crowd went there. After some time, the police vehicles escorted that car to what I assume was their station. </p>
<br>
<p>A few more videos emerged, this time from within the party. All seemed to be enjoying themselves, red cups in their hands. They seemed to be there by choice. Suddenly, the videos were deleted. Not much was known about the situation thereafter.</p>
