<h2>A Grain Of Salt</h2>
      <br>
<h3>1st July, 2023</h3>      

<br> <br>

<p>There are several, often varying viewpoints to any given situation, sometimes right, sometimes wrong, sometimes neither...</p>

<br>

<p>But who decides which viewpoint is right and which one is wrong? Maybe people have a feeling. Or maybe external influences like society or community play a role.
A viewpoint is correct according to one person, wrong according to another, and maybe nonsense to somebody else.</p>

<br>

<p>There is no way (that I am aware of) to know if a viewpoint is 100% correct or incorrect.
What you think might be right, or it might be wrong. Of course, its up to you to decide, but <b>objectively, what is right and what is wrong?</b> </p>

<br>

<p>Take everything with a grain of salt. 
Never believe anything fully. Similarly, never disbelieve anything fully. What you think you know might be wrong... or it might be right.</p>

<br>

<p>For quality of life, however, <b>one has to ultimately settle upon a single viewpoint</b>. You can't be suspicious of everything.
For this, it might be suitable to maintain a system of <b>75% believing what you know and 25% not believing what you know</b>, or being suspicious of it.</p>

<br>

<p>The numbers may vary from person to person and community to community, but personally, I think the above mentioned system should work fine for most people.</p>

<br>

<p>It is important to mention that <b>a viewpoint doesn't have to be correct or incorrect. It might be somewhere in the middle.</b>
It might be a 0, 1 or 0.5 or some other number between 0 and 1. </p>

<br>

<p>Also, I might be completely wrong and not fit to comment on this topic, so again, take everything with a grain of salt.</p>
